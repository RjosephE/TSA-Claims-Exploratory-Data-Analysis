# Capstone Project Module 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis
## TSA Claims Data Analysis

## Problem Statement
The Operations Management Team is a component of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) that establishes standards and directives, emergency preparedness, and determines the effectiveness of security operation programs. This management team intends to leverage the claims data in the process of **understanding the outcome and frequency of TSA claims in different conditions from 2002-2015**. The understanding and information derived from the claims data can help the TSA in improving its security operations and further support its mission of protecting the nation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce.

Based on the analysis objectives of the operations management team, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to address the following questions:
* How is the trend of TSA claims from 2002-2015? 
* In which US airports are TSA claims more frequently received?
* What are the top items being claimed? 
* Where are claim incidents most likely to occur and what are the items frequently claimed at these locations? 
* What are the odds of getting claims approved?
